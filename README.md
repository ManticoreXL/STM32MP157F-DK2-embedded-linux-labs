# STM32MP157F-DK2-embedded-linux-labs
This repository documents my progress through the Bootlin Embedded Linux training. It includes configurations, custom packages, and source code for labs covering the bootloader (U-Boot), Linux kernel compilation, root filesystem creation (Buildroot), system integration with systemd, and application debugging on the STM32MP157F-DK2.
